# Emotion Detector

The proposed solution is based on the generation of a model of a convolutional neural network to detect different emotions in images that project the patterns
necessary to perform any detection. The latter is intended to be achieved from a training to this model, using different parameters that allow to improve
the accuracy of such training. For this, you must choose a data set or relevant dataset for the CNN approach and, therefore, for proper operation
of the network. In the gure 3.1, you can see the solution of the system at a general level.
Also, some libraries will be used for the visualization of the experimental results.
On the other hand, the proposed design will be presented to deploy the detector of emotions in the cloud. Finally, the design of a mobile client application is proposed
for the consumption of the detector's functionality.
